        <h4>My name is Mohamed Abdikarim Hussein. </h4><br> I graduated from university with a degree in Information Technology. <br> I want to be a programmer and am a bit familiar with some programming languages like Python and Java.  This familiarity makes me love coding. I am now on the journey to becoming a full-stack developer. I am part of a group with my two elder brothers, and together, we are learning and building projects. </p>
